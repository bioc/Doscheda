<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Chemo- proteomics has recently become a great Mass Spectrometry
based tool for protein drug targets and off-targets identification and to date
there are no easy-to-use data analysis pipelines. 
</p>
<h3>Results</h3>

<p> We have created a Shiny-based Web application named DOSCHEDA (<u>Do</u>wn
<u>S</u>tream <u>Che</u>mo-Proteomics <u>D</u>ata <u>A</u>nalysis), to rapidly
assess the quality of the chemo-proteomics experiments and perform statistical
analysis for extraction of the most competed proteins.DOSCHEDA is designed to be used with minimal
user input and requires no programming, increasing its accessibility; it is
MS-software independent that is Proteome Discover or MaxQuant outputs are, but
not restricted to, accepted input types. DOSCHEDA aggregates results from
bioinformatics analyses of dose-response chemo-proteomics experiments into a
dynamic interface which includes interactive graphics and enables customized
output reports.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p> For detailed instructions on how to use DOSCHEDA please refer to the manual and walkthroughs available at the GitHub https://github.com/brunocontrino/DOSCHEDA</p> or view a combination of the manual and walkthroughs <a href="https://brunocontrino.github.io/DOSCHEDA"><i>here</a></i>.


<h3>Availability</h3>
<p> DOSCHEDA
is implemented entirely in the R language. It can be hosted/launched by any
system with R installed, including Windows, Mac OS and most Linux
distributions. Information technology administrators can also host DOSCHEDA
from a remote server, in which case users need only have a Web browser
installed. DOSCHEDA is provided free of charge under a GPL-3 open-source
license through  <a href="https://github.com/brunocontrino/DOSCHEDA"><i>GitHub</a></i></p>


See our <a href="https://brunocontrino.github.io/DOSCHEDA"><i>manual</a></i> for detailed explanation and examples. All documents and DOSCHEDA can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/brunocontrino/DOSCHEDA"><i>here</a></i>.
